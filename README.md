# Data-Analysis-Laptop price dataset


The Laptop price is varied from time to time as the system upgrades its technology to a newer version that automates and helps humans to manage a task easily. There are several companies that manufacture laptops, and their price depends on the quality, technology, specifications, and brand.

## Project Synopsis

>> This analysis and model will be used to find a correlation between specifications and laptop price as well as being used to predict laptop prices in the future. [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/).

-------------------------------
## Project Walk-through

### Data Collection

Laptop price dataset taken from the Kaggle website consisted of 12 attributes and 1.3K tuples, the attributes are: 'Company', 'TypeName', 'Inches', 'ScreenResolution', 'Cpu', 'Ram', 'Memory', 'Gpu', 'OpSys', 'Weight', 'Price', 'date'



------------------------------


## Data Cleaning

After collecting the data, replacing and filling values were handled using Replace function. Further, the technique of standardizing and normalizing has been incorporated. 

-------------------------------
## EDA {Exploratory Data Analysis}

* All the imported distributions from the data cleaning data set, I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various numerical and categorical variables.
* Using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**, categorized and crafted a beautiful data visualisation charts & plots.
* Used Machine Learning to build a model to predict the prices of a laptop using multiple regression and clustering techniques. 
* Below are a few highlights from the *Pivot tables, Barplots & HeatMaps*.
